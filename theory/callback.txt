1.WHAT IS CALLBACK?
->Callback is an asynchronous equivalent for a function. A callback function is called at the completion of a given task.
-> Node uses callback , All the APIs of Node are written in such a way that they support callbacks.
->a function to read a file may start reading file and return the control to the execution environment immediately so that the next instruction can be executed. 
Once file I/O is complete, it will call the callback function while passing the callback function, the content of the file as a parameter. So there is no blocking or wait for File I/O
ex:
input.text   =>non blocking code
var fs = require("fs");

fs.readFile('input.txt', function (err, data) {
   if (err) return console.error(err);
   console.log(data.toString());
});

console.log("callback example ");

output:-
callback example
non blocking code(input file content)
